# system dependent files
These directories contain files that differ between systems. There is a
zmap initialization file, which sets system dependant parameters. 
One such exmaple, would be font size, which differs between windows and mac systems.

It is possible other files would be here too.  Especially .fig files.

At startup, one of these subdirectories will be added to the path, dependent on the system being used.
