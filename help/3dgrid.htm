<UL><B><FONT FACE="Arial">ZMAP&nbsp; allow you to compute&nbsp; three dimensional grids
to spatially map b-values as well as z-values. Sampling volumes
are spherical rather then cylindrical as used in a map or cross sectional
approach. A slicer tool allows interactive slicing the 3 dimensional
data matrix along vertical or horizontal planes. With some effort, topography
  can be plotted on top.&nbsp;</FONT></B>

<P><B>To produce a 3D b-value analysis it is necessary to first prepare
the data set of interest. Choose the appropriate period, magnitude range,
depth range, area etc. and make this data set the current data selection
(for example using the "Keep as ZG.newcat" option from the Cumulative number
window).&nbsp; Then select the&nbsp; "Mapping b-values -> Calculate a 3D
b-value distribution" option from the Tools menu of the seismicity map.
The following input parameter window will appear:</B>

  <P><img border="0" src="3dgrid1.gif" align="left" width="406" height="295">The
sample size is the number of nearest neighbors in a spherical volume that
should be analyzed around each grid node.&nbsp; In addition, the grid node
spacing in dx, dy and dz must be defined. Note the the spacing in dx and
dy is in degrees, and in dz in kilometers! Lastly, the depth range to be
analyzed needs to be defined, first the deeper extend,&nbsp; next the shallower
extent.&nbsp; Click OK. To define the area of analysis, define a polygon in the
  map window. The resulting 2D projection of the grid nodes will be displayed.&nbsp;
  If the grid seems too dense, or the waitbar progress seems too slow, interrupt the calculation using&nbsp; Control C in the Matlab command window&nbsp;
and start again.&nbsp; Once the computation is done you
may save the results into a *.mat file, or select "Cancel"&nbsp;to not save
the results.<BR CLEAR=BOTH>

<BR>Analyzing three dimensional grids is not a simple matter, and the two ZMAP
  tools to slice and analyze the data are, unfortunately, not very satisfying
  solutions. After the grid is completed, you can choose from two different viewers:
  1) The Slicer in map view, which allows you to view different depth slices
  through your data. 2) The 3D slicer, which allows you to create combinations
  of horizontal and vertical planes, possibly overlain by topography. The first
  analysis tool includes the ability to interactively view the seismicty data
  sample at each node. The 2nd tool is generally more suiate to cerate 'pretty'
  summary plots.&nbsp;<P><img border="0" src="3dgrid2.gif" width="406" height="107"><P><font color="#FFFFFF" size="5" face="Arial">1)
  The slicer in map view</font>

<P><img border="0" src="3dgrid3.gif" width="626" height="480"><P>The window
  displays a horizontal slice through the 3D data matrix at a depth that is
  indicated in the title of the axes. To move to a different depth. move the
  slider on the top left. To cumulative number of events and the frequency
  magnitude distribution are displayed in the two right frames for two selected
  sample volumes. The respective volumes are marked by a red star and green
  triangle in the map. These frames are automatically updated when the star or triangle
  are moved, or the depth is changed. The radius of the sampled volume is marked
  by a white circle. To analyze a particular volume in more detail , select the
  V1 and V2 button on the upper right. The range of the caxis can be set using
  the buttons near the colorbar. To view a different map, use the pull-down menu
  on the lower left. The slicer button will open the alternative data viewer
  described below. Lastly, a cross-sectiional view through the data space can be
  obtained using the &quot;Define X-section' button in the upper left. The
  cursor changes to a cross; select the starting point of the x-section, then
  draw a&nbsp; line and release the button at the end point of the
  x-section.&nbsp;

<P><font size="5" color="#FFFFFF">2) The slicer in 3D view&nbsp;</font>

<P><img border="0" src="3dgrid4.gif" align="left" width="388" height="342">The
slicer window will open up, and show a map of the seismicity under investigation.
You can now define vertical cross section in any orientation and length,
as well as horizontal slices through the 3D data matrix. To define a vertical
cross section through your data, click on the "Define X-section" button.
Next click in the map area to define the start point of the x-section and
hold and drag a line to the endpoint. To view this x-section, select the
"new vert. slice" button. To add this line to an existing slice, use the
"Add vert. slice" option. "refresh" will redraw this window to erase old
x-section lines.&nbsp; You can also slice horizontally, either starting
a new slice, or adding to an existing plot of horizontal and/or vertical
x-sections.&nbsp;<BR CLEAR=BOTH>

<BR>The resulting 3 dimensional cube can be rotated in any direction
by simply clicking and dragging the mouse. For horizontal slices, the "Above"
view help to orient the cube. Earthquake hypocenters, coastlines, and faults
can be plotted as well, however, the Matlab 3D rendering algorithm does
not always produce satisfying results for oblique views. lastly, you can
plot Topography. Use the "Add Topo" button at the upper right corer of
the figure, and select either a planar contour type rendering of the topography,
or true 3D rendering. The topography plotted will be the same as used&nbsp;
last from the Seismicity map window (either ETOPO2 or mydem will be used).
A mouse rotation will now rotate the view-point of the topography, which
is the top layer in the plot. To make the viewpoint equal for both topography
and data cube, use the "Fix View" button in the lower left corner

around with different slice orientations and view-points, or using different
light sources, color maps etc. See the&nbsp;</B>
