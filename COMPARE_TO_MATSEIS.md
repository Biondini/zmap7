# Comparing ZMAP to MapSeis

## Main Map image

1. Events are grouped into catagories and plotted that way, not with absolute sizes
2. *Ticks* are outward facing, with "nice" values such as whole and half latitudes/longitudes.  Ticks are smallish, with minor ticks showing. All plots, except fmd (Xaxis) show minor ticks. 

    **IMPELMENTED** minor ticks in zmap main window

3. Context Menus
    1. `Plot this frame as new figure` apparently does a dumb copy with no menus or context menus. 
    
    **REIMPLIMENTED** in ZMAP. all tabs now have the option to `"Copy contents to new figure (static)"` 
4. PLOT OPTION menu

### other stuff

- Twin Catalog Selector exists
- Selected circular region has a dot in the center
- 3D plot has a set-superelevation option

## Functionality to add to ZMAP
- Declustering
- Stress Field Inversion
