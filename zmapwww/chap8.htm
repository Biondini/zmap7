<img SRC="chap8aa.gif" >Comparing seismicity rates</h2>
<a NAME="997189"></a><b><font size=+1>Compare-Fit option.</font></b>
<p>When you select "Compare-Fit" from the "Tools" pulldown menu of the
cumulative number window, you will start a comparison of the seismicity
rates in two time periods. This includes the fitting of possible magnitude
shifts, or stretches of magnitude scale, by means of synthetic b-value
plots. Also provided are estimates for the b-value, minimum magnitude of
completeness, and mean rate for each period, as well as a result of performing
a z-test comparing the rates of the two periods. This routine was developed
mainly by Ramon Zuniga. For a more detailed description on magnitude stretches,
see <i>Zuniga and Wyss</i> (1995).
<p><a NAME="996755"></a>After selecting the "Compare-fit" option&nbsp;
in the cumulative number plot window, a time selection widow appears. FOUR
TIME END-POINTS MUST BE SELECTED, which define the two time intervals.
This can be done either by entering numerical values (e.g. 1988.65), or
by using the cursor directly on the cumulative number plot. The intervals
may overlap each other.
<p><a NAME="996756"></a>An observed frequency-magnitude relation (normalized
to a year) for each interval is plotted with different symbols. The first
interval is labeled as "background", while the subsequent interval is the
"foreground". TWO MAGNITUDE END-POINTS MUST THEN BE DEFINED FOR EACH CURVE
to obtain an estimated b-value for each interval; these have to be selected
on the basis of the linearity of the observed curves. Once this selection
has been performed, the routine attempts to fit the background to the foreground
by assuming two possibilities:
<p><a NAME="996757"></a>(1) The background is first adjusted to fit the
foreground by assuming a simple magnitude shift. The shift is estimated
from the separation between the two curves and by using the minimum magnitude
at which the curve departs from a linear fit by more than one standard
deviation.
<p><a NAME="996758"></a>(2) The background, Mback, is matched to the foreground,
Mfore, by assuming a linear magnitude transformation (stretch or compression
of magnitude scale) of the type (<i>Zuniga and Wyss</i>, 1995):
<p><a NAME="996759"></a>Mfore = c * Mback + dM
<p><a NAME="996760"></a>where c and dM are constants.
<p>Results are graphically displayed in a new window which shows:
<br>a) The frequency-magnitude distribution of the foreground and the frequency-magnitude
distribution of the corrected background, using the last values for c and
dM (for the first run, it uses the values found from a direct comparison
between background and foreground).
<br>b) Magnitude histograms for both foreground and corrected background
<br>c) Magnitude signatures (if needed)
<p><a NAME="997349"></a><img SRC="chap8a.jpg" height=80% width=70%>
<p><a NAME="997190"></a>FIGURE 49. (next page) The "Compare-Fit" output
window
<p><a NAME="996827"></a>The results window includes the Gutenberg-Richter
relation estimation for the original backround and foreground as well as
the minimum magnitudes for each and a Z-score calculated between both rates.
It also indicates the values which give the best fit to the selected trend
for
<br>the two aforementioned possibilities (simple shift and complete linear
relation or stretch).
<br>A rate change between the two intervals can also be accounted for by
applying a correction to the number of events given in terms of a factor.&nbsp;
The values estimated for dM, c, and rate factor can be manually changed
to test&nbsp; results for any combination specified by the user. For example,
entering c = 1 and fac = 1, returns results of a simple magnitude shif
specified by the value of dM.
<br>As expected, using dM = 0, c = 1, and fac = 1 returns the result of
a comparison between background and foreground without fit (same result
as the Compare-no fit option, see below).

<p><a NAME="996855"></a>FIGURE 50. The results from "Compare"
<p>Selecting the "Magnitude Signature" button produces two magnitude signatures,
calculated from a comparison between foreground and background as well
as from comparing the last synthetic foreground which was estimated to
the actual foreground.
<p><a NAME="996856"></a><b><font size=+1>Compare-No Fit option.</font></b><b><font size=+1></font></b>
<p>It is also possible to perform a shortened comparison of two seismicity
periods. The "Compare-no fit" option in the Tools menu of the cumulative
number plot will ask for four dates which can be entered either using the
mouse or keyboard. The normalized number and cumulative number versus magnitude
will be displayed, and a magnitude signature can be calculated (<a href="chap8.htm#996875">Figure
51</a>).
<p>This option also provides probability values after applying Utsu's test
to compare both distributions and other useful parameters such as
<b><i>a</i></b>
and <b><i>b</i></b> values, standard deviations for both, and Minimum magnitudes
.

<h2>
GenAS</h2>
<a NAME="997198"></a>In the main map window you can select GenAS (Generate
AS). This tool was introduced by Habermann (1983) to find all significant
rate changes in an earthquake catalog. GenAS will ask you for a minimum
magnitude and a magnitude increment (<a href="chap8.htm#997396">Figure
52</a>). GenAS uses the current catalog, and you can limit your analysis
to a subarea by using "Select". <a href="chap8.htm#997403">Figure 53</a>,
27, and 28 show the output of GenAS. GenAS calculates cumulative number
curves for different magnitude cutoffs (below and above). When the AS(t)
function detects a z-value above 2.57, (this is the 99% confidence level),
it will plot a `+' in the output window for the magnitude band in question.
For a significant seismicity rate decrease (z &lt; -2.57) a `-' will be
plotted. GenAS varies the two endpoints of the AS(t) function, this makes
it possible to find all significant magnitude changes in the catalog. Using
the "save out" option, the points of significant change will be saved in
the file above.out and below.out in the ZMAP home-directory.

<h2>
Using GENAS with a Grid</h2>
<a NAME="997279"></a>In the GENAS input parameter window (<a href="chap8.htm#997396">Figure
52</a>), you can select "GENASGRID". This will open another input parameter
box asking you to give the grid-spacing in latitude and longitude, and
the number of events sampled around each gridpoint. Just as for the cumulative
number grid, (necessary to produce z-value maps), you will be asked to
define the location of the grid by defining the lower left and upper right
corner in the map window. A GENAS analysis will be performed for each gridpoint.
A wait-bar shows the percentage of the total analysis completed, and each
individual GENAS output window (<a href="chap8.htm#997403">Figure 53</a>and
<a href="chap8.htm#997268">Figure
54</a>) will be displayed. The final result of this analyses is a plot
of the significant changes as a function of grid-note (that is all grid-points
in a line [1,1],[1,2],[1,3]...[2,1],[2,2]....).
<a href="chap8.htm#997296">Figure
56</a> shows an example of such a plot. All magnitude bands in the analysis
are displayed as one value, either the mean z-value or the absolute sum.
Although this plot may give some indications of where significant rate
changes are located in time and space, the output is rather hard to interpret.
<p><a NAME="997290"></a>In addition, you can now select a time-cut, and
a GENAS map will be displayed at this time-cut. See the section on z-value
maps for details about z-value maps and the z-value map window.

the z-value as a function of time and grid-node. The left plot shows the
mean z-value for all magnitude bands using GENAS. The right plot shows
the absolute sum of all the z-values using GENAS.
