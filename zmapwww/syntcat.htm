<h2>
Overview</h2>
<a NAME="996910"></a>How significant is a seismicity rate decrease, or
a b-value increase? Using randomized catalogs and synthetic catalogs can
help to resolve these questions. The "Monte Carlo" submenu from the Tools
option of the Seismicity Window offers a number of newly developed techniques
<p><a NAME="996931"></a>
<p><a NAME="996923"></a>
<h2>
Evaluate random z-value distribution (one window-length)</h2>
<a NAME="996937"></a>A random sample containing N events is drawn from
the data. The cumulative number curve is constructed, and LTA(t) function
for a window-length Tw calculated. This process is repeated K times. The
resulting histogram of (K x number of time-steps) z-values is displayed
(Figure ??). On top of the real distribution, a normal distribution with
the same number of events, and the same mean and standard deviation is
plotted as a yellow line.
<p><a NAME="996940"></a>This histogram can give clues to the distribution
of seismicity rate changes in the catalog. A `good' catalog will show an
almost normally distributed distribution with a mean of about zero. For
a synthetic dataset with a poissonian distribution of the events, one would
expect a mean of zero and a standard deviation of 2.57. Often the distributions
are skewed towards the positive side, indicating more seismicity rate decreases
than increases in the catalog. Sometimes a bimodal distribution can be
detected, the meaning of which is somewhat unclear.&nbsp;<img SRC="syntcata.gif" >

<h2>
Evaluate random z-value distribution (window-length)</h2>
<a NAME="996941"></a>The random z-value evaluation can be repeated for
a number of different window-length Tw. The results of this analysis can
be plotted in a graph of the range of b as a function of window-length
Tw. The absolute maximum and minimum values, the 1 and&nbsp;<img SRC="syntcab1.gif" >99
percentiles, and the mean will be shown. In general, the range of z will
decrease with increasing window-length.

<h2>
Evaluate random b-value distribution</h2>
<a NAME="996869"></a>This option will explore the dependency of the b-
and a-value and the sample size. Instead of using synthetic catalogs (Bender,
1983), the original data is used in the following way:
<ul>
<ul><a NAME="996872"></a>
<li>
Draw a sample of size N from the catalog<a NAME="996873"></a></li>

<li>
Estimate the b-and a-values using both the maximum likelihood technique
and the weighted least squares technique, either with or without an automatic
estimation of the magnitude of completeness.<a NAME="996874"></a></li>

<li>
Repeat the process k times.&nbsp;<a NAME="996875"></a></li>

<li>
Repeat the process for a different sample size N.&nbsp;<a NAME="996879"></a>A
plot of the distribution of b-values for one sample size is shown in Figure
? The estimates are approximately normally distributed. The width the distribution
and to a smaller extend the mean of the distribution depends on the sample
size N - the larger the sample size, the smaller the range over which the
b-value varies.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><a NAME="996886"></a>The confidence limits for the Parkfield region
for <i>N=100</i> are about <font face="Symbol">D</font>b = +/- 0.15 and
<font face="Symbol">D</font>a
= +/- 0.16, for <i>N = 250</i> we find <font face="Symbol">D</font>b =
+/- 0.08, and <font face="Symbol">D</font>a = +/- 0.11. Generally, the
maximum likelihood method results in a more constant mean and a more symmetric
distribution of the b-values around the mean than the weighted least squares
approach. We found that using our technique, lower-quality data-sets such
as the early recording period (1971-1980) for the Calaveras fault, show
larger confidence limits of <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> (Wiemer and Wyss, 1996).

<h2>
Calculate a random b map and compare to observed data.</h2>
<a NAME="20000901"></a>This option can help distinguish b-value variations
which stand out as too large or too low. The idea is to compare the observed
b-value distribution, as in a b-value map, to a "synthetic" distribution
based on a random permutation of magnitudes, preserving the original hypocenter
location and time.
<p>This task is acomplished in the following way:
<br>&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>
Create a second catalog using original catalog and applying a random permutation
on the magnitude data</li>

<li>
Add 500 years to date, and concatenate to original catalog as a consecutive
time period</li>

<li>
Use the differential b-map routines to calculate a b-value map for both
original and permutted data</li>

<li>
Differential maps allow the user to select which map is to be displayed:
first (original data) period, second period (permutted data) or difference.
Note: dates for the permutted data are not true values, original data is
kept unchanged as the first period.</li>

<li>
Using the probability button the difference is displayed only for values
which exceed a user-defined confidence (Utsu's test is applied)</li>
</ul>

<p><br>NOTE:&nbsp; The routine changes the original catalog, concatenating&nbsp;
the "synthetic" data to it. If needed, other routines can be performed
on separate sections of the data (see for example, the "Compare" options
under the Cumulative number Vs. Time display). If you want to reset the
catalog to its original form, use the "Reset Catalog" button on the differential
b-map display.
<p>The following figure shows an example of resulting b-map.
