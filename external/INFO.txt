5) External calls in ZMAP
If you are planning to run stress tensor inversions, you need to run several executables. These maybe already precompiled for your operating system. The HOWTO_invert is a description of how to use A. Michael's code. Gephardt's program is described in the reference J.W. Gephardt, FMSI: A fortran program for inverting fault/slickenside and  earthquake focal mechanism data to obtain the regional stress tensor, Computer & Geosciences, Vol. 16, No. 7, pp. 953-989, 1990

Windows PC systems: The necessary *.exe files are included in the ZMAPv6.exe distribution and should run without problems.

UNIX systems: Several makefiles have been provided by Andy Michael as part of his stress tensor inversion software. The can be found in the ./external directory. Specifically, you will need to run:

makeslfast
makeslick
makebtswl

Linux systems: (Suse Linux 8.0 nad later)
Compiler: We are using g77 and the makefiles given by A. Michael!
Michael's code: Precompiled are the executables
slick           (make -f makeslick)
slfast          (make -f makeslfast)
bootslickw      (make -f makebtswl)
bothplanes      (make -f makeboth, not used in Matlab-scripts, but nice to compute the second possible fault plane)

Gephardt's code:
Compiler: We are using g77.
I had to change some FORMAT lines in the original fmsti_ste.f and datasetDD.f, so the ones used for Linux are indicated.
fmsi_ste_linuxg77.f    (g77 -o fmsi_ste fmsi_ste_linuxg77.f)
datasetupDD_linuxg77.f (g77 -o datasetupDD datasetupDD_linuxg77.f)


Depending on your system, you may have to change some compiler options.

Gephart’s stress tensor inversion program and the cumulative misfit method are precompiled for the Windows version. If you want to run them on a different operating system, please contact me, I will provide you with the necessary codes.

If you would like to use Reasenbergs declustering code as a FORTRAN executables rather then the Matlab internal version (because it is faster and you do get the output of the clusters in Reasenbergs form), you need to compile the file ./external/myclus.f. (e.g., f90 –o myclus myclus.f) This should also already work in the PC version.
